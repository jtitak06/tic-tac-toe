**My Process**

This project entails a two person tic-tac-toe game. The first step to build this project was to create the HTML and CSS. I wanted to create a board with a gradient background and solid black grid outline. The X squares and the O squares were made to be different colors and change to green to signify a winner. Lastly, there needed to be a button to restart the game. That button is at the bottom of the page.

Writing the code in the JS file involved a lot of logic. While I was able to execute some of the simple tasks, I had the help of a YouTube video. I tried to find a longer video so many of the steps could be explained in a manner that I would understand it. This involved console logging every step before writing the logic to make sure that everything was registering properly in the console. Once this was done, the logic for each component of the tic-tac-toe game was written and implemented.
